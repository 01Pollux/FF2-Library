	// INSTRUCTIONS FOR FINDING RECTANGLES AND LIGHT SPOTS:
	// - Turn on noclip on a private server
	// - Go into console and set the following: cl_showpos 1
	// - Go to your rectangle start in noclip mode. Note that this spot is at EYE level, not where your feet are.
	// - Copy coords you see on the top right.
	// - Repeat this process for rectangle end, and where you wish to place the light.
